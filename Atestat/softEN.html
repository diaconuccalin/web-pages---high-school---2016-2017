	The Raspberry Pi Foundation recommends the use of Raspbian, a Debian-based Linux operating system. Other third party operating systems available via the official website include Ubuntu MATE, Snappy Ubuntu Core, Windows 10 IoT Core, RISC OS and specialised distributions for the Kodi media center and classroom management. Many other operating systems can also run on the Raspberry Pi.

	<h2>Driver APIs</h2>
Raspberry Pi can use a VideoCore IV GPU via a binary blob, which is loaded into the GPU at boot time from the SD-card, and additional software, that initially was closed source. This part of the driver code was later released. However, much of the actual driver work is done using the closed source GPU code. Application software use calls to closed source run-time libraries (OpenMax, OpenGL ES or OpenVG) which in turn calls an open source driver inside the Linux kernel, which then calls the closed source VideoCore IV GPU driver code. The API of the kernel driver is specific for these closed libraries. Video applications use OpenMAX, 3D applications use OpenGL ES and 2D applications use OpenVG which both in turn use EGL. OpenMAX and EGL use the open source kernel driver in turn.
<br><br>
	<h2>Firmware</h2>
	The official firmware is a freely redistributable binary blob, that is closed-source. A minimal open source firmware is also available.
<br><br>
	<h2>Third party application software</h2>
	<li>AstroPrint - AstroPrint's wireless 3D printing software can be run on the Pi 2
	<li>C/C++ Interpreter CH - Released 3 January 2017, C/C++ interpreter Ch and Embedded Ch are released free for non-commercial use for Rasperry Pi, ChIDE is also included for the beginners to learn C/C++
	<li>Mathematica and the Wolfram language - Since 21 November 2013, Raspbian includes a full installation of this proprietary software for free. As of 24 August 2015, the version is Mathematica 10.2. Programs can be run either from a command line interface or from a Notebook interface. There are Wolfram Language functions for accessing connected devices. There is also a Wolfram Language desktop development kit allowing development for Raspberry Pi in Mathematica from desktop machines, including features from the loaded Mathematica version such as image processing and machine learning.
	<li>Minecraft - Released 11 February 2013, a version for the Raspberry Pi, in which you can modify the game world with code, the only official version of the game in which you can do so.
	<li>RealVNC - Since 28 September 2016, Raspbian includes RealVNC's remote access server and viewer software
	<li>UserGate Web Filter
