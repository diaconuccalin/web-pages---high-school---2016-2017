	The Raspberry Pi community was described by Jamie Ayre of FLOSS software company AdaCore as one of the most exciting parts of the project. Community blogger Russell Davis said that the community strength allows the Foundation to concentrate on documentation and teaching.
	<br><br>The community developed a fanzine around the platform called The MagPi which in 2015, was handed over to the Raspberry Pi Foundation by its volunteers to be continued in-house. A series of community Raspberry Jam events have been held across the UK and around the world.

<br><br>

<h2>Use in education</h2>
As of January 2012, enquiries about the board in the United Kingdom have been received from schools in both the state and private sectors, with around five times as much interest from the latter. It is hoped that businesses will sponsor purchases for less advantaged schools. The CEO of Premier Farnell said that the government of a country in the Middle East has expressed interest in providing a board to every schoolgirl, in order to enhance her employment prospects.
<br><br>
In 2014, the Raspberry Pi Foundation hired a number of its community members including ex-teachers and software developers to launch a set of free learning resources for its website. The resources are freely licensed under Creative Commons, and contributions and collaborations are encouraged on social coding platform GitHub.
<br><br>
The Foundation also started a teacher training course called Picademy with the aim of helping teachers prepare for teaching the new computing curriculum using the Raspberry Pi in the classroom. The continued professional development course is provided free for teachers and is run by the Foundation's education team.
<br><br>
<h2>Use in home automation</h2>
There are a number of developers and applications that are leveraging the Raspberry Pi for home automation. These programmers are making an effort to modify the Raspberry Pi into a cost-affordable solution in energy monitoring and power consumption. Because of the relatively low cost of the Raspberry Pi, this has become a popular and economical solution to the more expensive commercial alternatives.
<br><br>
<h2>Use in industrial automation</h2>
In June 2014, TECHBASE, Polish industrial automation manufacturer designed world's first industrial computer based on Rapberry Pi Compute Module, called ModBerry. The device has numerous interfaces, most notably RS-485/232 serial ports, digital and analog inputs/outputs, CAN and economical 1-Wire buses, all of which are widely used in automation industry. The design allows the use of Compute Module in harsh industrial environments, leading to conclusion, that Raspberry Pi is no longer limited to home and science projects only, but can be widely used as Industrial IoT solution and achieve goals of Industry 4.0.
<br><br>
<h2>Use in commercial products</h2>
OTTO is a digital camera created by Next Thing Co. It incorporates a Raspberry Pi Compute Module. It was successfully crowd-funded in a May 2014 Kickstarter campaign.
<br><br>Slice is a digital media player which also uses a Compute Module as its heart. It was crowd-funded in an August 2014 Kickstarter campaign. The software running on Slice is based on Kodi.
